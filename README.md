# G.P.A.M.
## General Purpose And Music Discord Bot - *Not in working condition*

## End Goal
G.P.A.M. is a fully modular bot – meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your liking, making it completely customizable. This is also a self-hosted bot – meaning you will need to host and maintain your own instance. You can turn G.P.A.M. into an admin bot, music bot, trivia bot, new best friend or all of these together!

The default set of modules includes and is not limited to:

- Moderation features (kick/ban/softban/hackban, mod-log, filter, chat cleanup)
- Music features (YouTube, SoundCloud, local files, playlists, queues)
- Stream alerts (Twitch, Youtube)
- Bank (slot machine, user credits)
- Custom commands
- Imgur/gif search
- Admin automation (self-role assignment, cross-server announcements, mod-mail reports)

## Installation
The following platforms are officially supported:

## Plugins
