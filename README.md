# Barley

## General Purpose Discord Bot - *Under Construction*

## End Goal

Barley is a fully modular bot – meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your liking, making it completely customizable. This is also a self-hosted bot – meaning you will need to host and maintain your own instance.

The set of modules includes:

- Moderation features (kick/ban/softban/hackban, mod-log)
- Music features (YouTube, SoundCloud, local files, playlists, queues)
- Stream alerts (Twitch, Youtube)
- Bank (slot machine, user credits)

## Installation

The following platforms are officially supported:

- Windows
- MacOS
- Most major linux distributions

## Plugins

I'm gonna research dis stuff:

- Cleverbot integration
- Ban sync
- Welcome messages
- Casino
- Reaction roles
